**Letter of support --- `r rmarkdown::metadata$params$personTitle` `r rmarkdown::metadata$params$personName` `r rmarkdown::metadata$params$personSurname`**

I have spoken to `r rmarkdown::metadata$params$personName` several times, as part of my duties as `r possessive` personal tutor. `r stringr::str_to_title(pronoun)` has sruck me, from our very first encounter, as a very focussed student, with clear ideas as to what `r possessive` academic life should bring `r adjective`.

`r stringr::str_to_title(pronoun)` is trying to gather as much experience as possible in order to make up `r possessive` mind as to what career pathway `r pronoun` would like to go through. `r stringr::str_to_title(possessive)` career so far indicates that `r pronoun` is a bright student with a potential for excellent research outputs, given suitable supervision. `r stringr::str_to_title(pronoun)` has trained in different aspects of statistical modelling and has a keen interest in `r interests`; thus I believe that being hosted at `r rmarkdown::metadata$params$institution` will certainly be beneficial for `r adjective`, as I believe `r pronoun` will be able to draw on different levels of expertise and research interests to feed into `r possessive` own project. 

I believe `r pronoun` will be a very good candidate to fill the position at your institution. `r stringr::str_to_title(pronoun)` is definitely eager to learn and apply `r possessive` strengths to relevant issues. Thus, I believe that `r pronoun` can succeed in getting a postgraduate degree and then contribute to the field as a good researcher.
